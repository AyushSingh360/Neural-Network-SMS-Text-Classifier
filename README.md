# 📱 Neural Network SMS Text Classifier

This project is part of the [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) curriculum. It focuses on building a machine learning model that classifies SMS messages as either **spam** or **ham (not spam)** using a neural network.

---

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Build a binary text classification model using a **neural network**.
- Preprocess and vectorize text data (tokenization, stop word removal, etc.).
- Train and evaluate the model on the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset**.
- Measure model accuracy and understand the limitations of simple neural classifiers in NLP.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- Text preprocessing (tokenization, padding, etc.)
- Binary classification with neural networks
- Word embeddings and vectorization
- Training and evaluating ML models
- Use of TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch)

---

## 🗃 Dataset

This project uses the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset**, a public dataset of labeled SMS messages (spam or ham), originally curated at [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection).

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow (or PyTorch)
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for visualization)

## 🧪 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Neural-Network-SMS-Text-Classifier.git
   cd Neural-Network-SMS-Text-Classifier
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the training script**
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

4. **(Optional) Test the model**
   ```bash
   python test_model.py
   ```

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

The model is evaluated based on:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

These metrics help assess how well the model distinguishes between spam and ham messages.

---

## 📌 Features

- End-to-end workflow: from data cleaning to model evaluation
- Easy to run and extend
- Modular code structure
- Jupyter notebooks for visualization and experimentation (optional)
